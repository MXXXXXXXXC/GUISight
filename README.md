# GUISight

>To relieve testing tool's dependency's on GUI API and framework, we develop this tool. It is easy to adapted GUiSight to the automatic GUI testing of apps on other platform. In this repo, we adapt it to test Linux Desktop apps and Android apps.

## Introduce to this tool

* The GUI-detection technique used in this tool is build upon UIED,  and we improve its performance. Please refer to [this link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3368089.3417940?casa_token=nlSz6krp82MAAAAA:bc8QgFyUCYAZXu4GfcnMPsXGu7PeqB8TK8tuEV08THlwazAdwkuwQku1MeTUSY77rCa4nO6NpOjlKQ) for UIED. And (URL) for our improvements.
* Our novel testing tool is a combination of vision-based GUI detection and model-based testing. (URL) for detail.
